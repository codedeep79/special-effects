            There are many apple trees in a garden. They’re good friends. One day an old tree is ill. There are many
            pests in the tree. Leaves of the tree turn yellow. The old tree feels very sad and unwell. Another tree
            sends for a doctor for him. At first, they send for a pigeon, but she has no idea about it. Then they send
            for an oriole, and she can’t treat the old tree well. Then they send for a woodpecker. She is a good doctor.
            She pecks a hole in the tree and eats lots of pests. At last the old tree becomes better and better.
